The notebooks in this repository were created with LLM assistance to see how well AI can work as copilots for developing notebooks and conducting astronomical research.

Written by Daniel Western in conjunction with Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, "JWSTandALMASearch" queries both the ALMA and JWST data archives for an object of the user's choice, then cross-references observations of the object from both archives and plots the positions of all observations near the central coordinates in right ascension and declination.
Some additions to the code, such as retry logic for network errors and switching to the European mirror of the NRAO-ALMA archive, were included by Gemini.
